comment: >
    Two related searches for phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM) are performed using events with hadronic jets 
    and significant transverse momentum imbalance. The results are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a 
    center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016--2018 and corresponding to an 
    integrated luminosity of 137 fb$^{-1}$. The first search is inclusive, based on signal regions defined by the hadronic energy 
    in the event, the jet multiplicity, the number of jets identified as originating from bottom quarks, and the value 
    of the kinematic variable $M_\mathrm{T2}$ for events with at least two jets. For events with exactly one jet, the transverse
    momentum of the jet is used instead. The second search looks in addition for disappearing tracks produced by BSM 
    long-lived charged particles that decay within the volume of the tracking detector. No excess event yield is observed 
    above the predicted standard model background. This is used to constrain a range of BSM models that predict the following: 
    the pair production of gluinos and squarks in the context of supersymmetry models conserving $R$-parity, with or without 
    intermediate long-lived charginos produced in the decay chain; the resonant production of a colored scalar state decaying 
    to a massive Dirac fermion and a quark; or the pair production of scalar and vector leptoquarks each decaying to a 
    neutrino and a top, bottom, or light-flavor quark. In most of the cases, the results obtained are the most stringent 
    constraints to date.
