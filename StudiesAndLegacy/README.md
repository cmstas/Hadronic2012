# Studies & Legacy

If it isn't used frequently, or was relevant only in the analysis' early prototyping stages, or has been replaced by something newer and shinier, it's found here. The idea is to combat clutter,  make clear where the core analysis workflow can be found, and make it easier for new MT2-ers to get up to speed. If you need to run something in this directory (!), it's probably best to move its folder back to the base MT2Analysis directory, or move it back to the main scripts directory, run it, then move it back here when you're done.
