Runs on special minimal babies produced by ShortTrackTagAndProbeBabymaker. The eta-phi maps and Z-like mass distributions provide evidence that prompt electrons are lost and become short tracks at high rates in certain detector regions (corresponding closely to ECAL holes), requiring that these regions be vetoed. See FshortLooper/make_etaphi_veto.py. Perhaps some day there will also be enough stats to find muon holes, or a bad muon region of the detector.
