Script to make result plots based on the yields and uncertainties in the datacards.

Just edit the datacard directory and name format in do.py and run `python do.py`.

TO DO: add plot of every region integrated over MT2, figure out what to do for region 
labels in last bin that run off the plot

Note that this uses the pyRootPlotMaker found here:
https://github.com/cmstas/Software/tree/master/pyRootPlotMaker

Add that directory to your PYTHONPATH enviroment variable
