Script to make result plots based on the yields and uncertainties in the datacards.

Just edit the datacard directory and name in do.py and run `python do.py`.

TO DO: add uncertainties on prediction, monojet plot, "every region integrated over MT2" plot,
figure out what to do for region labels that run off the plot

Note that this uses the pyRootPlotMaker found here:
